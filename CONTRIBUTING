# Contributing

Please keep the [issue tracker](https://github.com/igwejk/workflow-doc/issues) limited to **bug reports** and **improvements**.

## General Questions and Support

If you have questions about how to use `workflow-doc` the best place to ask is in the [Discussions](https://github.com/igwejk/workflow-doc/discussions). Anything that isn't a bug report should be posted as a discussion instead.

## Pull Requests

- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your `main`)
- The `HEAD` commit must include a `change-type` line which addresses expectation of backward compatibility in the change.

  When a pull request is merged, the specified `change-type` will influence versioning and release as follows.

  - `change-type: backward-compatible fixes` will cause a patch increment
  - `change-type: backward-compatible features` will cause a minor increment
  - `change-type: backward-incompatible` will cause a major version increment
